//write a function that takes in an array of names and return an array of unique names. If the name already exists in the array, add a number behind it to make it unique. Increase the number by 1 if the name repeats again. Ex: input: ["ada", "john", "ada", "ada"]  output: ["ada", "john", "ada1", "ada2"]
